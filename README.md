For this assignment you will implement an address book library. Users of your address book library should be able to do the following.

-- Create an empty address book. 
-- Add an entry. An entry consists of a name, postal address, phone number, email address, and a note. 
-- Remove an entry. 
-- Search for an entry by any of the contact properties. 
-- Save the address book to a file. 
-- Read the address book from a file.

Remember the items we discussed in class. Make all emthods as short and private as possible, Clarity and readalibity are more important than efficiency. You must use javadocs for all your public classes and methods.
